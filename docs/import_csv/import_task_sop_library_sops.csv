Navigate to Platform Administration → Backup/Restore. This opens the backup dialog for the host device\n* Create Station Backup: Select the running Station in the backup dialog and click ""Backup Station"" (or ""Create Station Backup""). You will be prompted to choose a save location for the backup file (with extension .dist)\n  * Name the Backup: Use a clear naming convention (e.g. SchoolABuilding_2025-07-22_PMBackup) including date and type of service. This makes it easy to identify later.\n  * Include History/Alarms: If trend histories and alarm logs are needed in the backup, check the BackupService settings in the station Services to ensure those data folders are not excluded. *Note:* Including large histories can make backups big; if the history database is very large (over a couple GB), you may omit it and rely on separate history archiving (noted in section 3).\n  * Start Backup: Click ""Create"" to begin the backup and monitor the progress bar. A full station backup (.dist file) will be created, containing the entire station directory and any platform-specific config needed for restoration.\n* Verify & Store Backup: Confirm the backup completed successfully (you should see a success message or log). The backup .dist file is typically saved in your Workbench backups folder by default. Verify the file’s timestamp and size (should be tens or hundreds of MB, not 0 bytes). Store a copy of the backup in a safe location:\n  * Copy the backup file to an external drive or network location (and to cloud storage if used) for redundancy.\n  * If applicable, follow company policy to upload the backup to a central repository or the maintenance ticket for this site.\n* Test the Backup (Optional): As a best practice, occasionally test restoring a backup on a test station or offline Workbench to verify its integrity. Open the .dist with the Niagara Distribution File Installer to ensure it’s not corrupted and that the station database (.bog files) can load without errors.",,,,,"Perform backups regularly (at least quarterly for stable systems, and before/after any major change). Maintain multiple historical backups (e.g. last 3 backups) in case a recent one is corrupted or to roll back unintended changes.\nKeep backups secure – treat them as sensitive data. If possible, encrypt backup files or store them in access-controlled locations, since they contain system credentials and building control IP. Niagara can password-protect backups; use that feature if supported.\nMonitor backup size and storage. A typical Niagara station backup might range from 50–500 MB. Unusually small files could indicate an incomplete backup, while growing backup size over time may signal accumulating history data (consider purging history or using external logging to keep backup size manageable).\nIf a backup fails or the file is corrupt, do some troubleshooting: check for sufficient disk space on the Workbench PC and the JACE, close Workbench and reopen, or reboot the JACE if needed, then try again. Always resolve backup issues immediately – do not leave the site without a valid backup file.",true

This involves using Niagara’s diagnostic tools to check resource utilization and health of the station. *Station Summary (Resource Manager) view in Niagara Workbench, showing live CPU, memory, and other resource usage. In this example, heap memory use is about 50% and CPU is low, indicating healthy resource headroom.*",,"* Station Summary (Resource Manager): In Workbench, right-click the Station (in the Nav tree) and select Views → Station Summary (or Resource Manager in some profiles). This opens a live resource monitor page\n  * CPU Usage: Ensure CPU is not persistently high. A general guideline is that continuous CPU utilization should stay below ~80%; momentary peaks above 80% are normal, but sustained high CPU indicates an overload. If the station is on a JACE, remember the JACE has limited processing power – high CPU could cause slow control response or missed messages.\n  * Heap Memory: Check Java heap usage (memory). After garbage collection, used heap should be well under the maximum (ideally under ~75% of heap max during normal operation). If memory usage is above 80-90% and climbing, the station may eventually fail with an OutOfMemory error. High heap usage often ties to many history records or leaky logic (e.g. arrays growing). Plan to increase memory (for a Supervisor, allocate more heap in the niagara.conf or add RAM) or reduce load if needed.\n  * License Capacities: The resource view also shows counts like devices and points versus license limits. Ensure the station isn’t exceeding or near its licensed device/point limits (if so, some points may be unreliable). Niagara N4’s Resource Manager will flag in red if, for example, you’ve discovered more devices than allowed.\n  * File Descriptors (JACE specific): On JACE 8000, you can view open file descriptors count (in Resource Manager or via platformDiagnostics). The JACE has a hard limit (e.g. 8000 files/sockets). Honeywell recommends keeping the number of active histories and devices reasonable (e.g. <5000 histories) so as not to exhaust file handles.\n* Investigate Slow Components (Engine Hogs): If performance issues are suspected (e.g. control loops slow to react, or high CPU without obvious cause), use Niagara’s Spy tool:\n  * Right-click the Station and select Spy → sys.sysMgr → engineManager → engineHogs. This view lists the longest-running tasks in the station and their average execution times. Look for any component (like a particular control loop or program) with abnormally high execution time (e.g. hundreds of milliseconds). For example, a rogue logic block taking 500,000 µs (0.5 sec) every cycle could bog down the station. If found, investigate that component’s logic complexity or execution frequency. Real-world example: A poorly written PX graphic or a very fast-running script could appear here as an engine hog and might need optimization or a slower poll rate.\n* Driver Performance (Poll Rates): Check the performance of field bus communications:\n  * For polling protocols (Modbus, BACnet without COV, etc.), go to the network (e.g. Config → Drivers → ModbusNetwork) and inspect the Polling cycle times. Niagara typically has Fast/Normal/Slow poll cycles. Ensure the actual cycle times are meeting the configured intervals. For instance, if Normal polls are set for every 5 seconds, the actual cycle time should also be ~5s or less. If you see cycle times consistently longer (e.g. 8–10s for a 5s poll), it indicates the network is saturated or the JACE is too slow for the polling load. In such cases, consider optimizing by reducing poll frequency, using COV (change-of-value reporting) if available, or splitting devices onto multiple networks. Heavy polling not only affects that network’s data freshness but also CPU usage.\n  * Check device communication stats (many drivers have diagnostics like message counts, errors). A high error or retry count might point to communication wiring issues or overloaded traffic.\n* Application Director (System Log): Open the Platform → Application Director (real-time console log). This shows live station output messages. Look for warnings or errors scrolling by:\n  * Error messages: e.g. out-of-memory errors, driver communication failures, or module exceptions. These often highlight issues requiring attention (like a database error or a misconfigured object causing repetitive faults).\n  * Use the log filter (or Debug service) to increase log detail if troubleshooting a specific issue. For example, to debug a Modbus device, you could set the Modbus network’s log level to “Finest” to see all traffic in the Application Director. Just remember to set it back to default afterward to avoid performance impact.\n  * Save the log output if needed for further analysis (Workbench allows *streaming to file* for the Application Director output). This can be useful to share with a Tridium support engineer if diagnosing an elusive performance bug.\n* Verify Normal Operations: Finally, ensure that after diagnostics, all settings are returned to normal (e.g. if you enabled extra logging or disabled any service for testing, revert those changes). Check that CPU and memory remain stable after any tweaks. A healthy station typically runs with moderate CPU and with memory usage cycling up and down (garbage collection) but without trend toward exhaustion.\n\nAdditional Diagnostics from Innon.com:\n* Check Station Resource Manager: Right-click on the station and select ""Views - Station Summary"" to open a resource monitor page for CPU and memory.\n* Check Engine Hogs: Right-click on the station, select ""Spy,"" then navigate to ""sysManagers"" > ""engineManager"" > ""Engine Hogs"" to list components by execution time.\n* Check Driver Poll Rates: Verify cycle times in the driver property sheet; optimize if longer than configured.\n* Use Application Director Console: Access under ""Platform"" for live logs; stream to file for analysis.\n* Add Debug Information: Use Spy > logSetup or Services > Debug Service to set detailed logging for components (e.g., Modbus to ""finest"").",,,,,"Document baseline performance metrics during each visit (CPU%, heap%, device counts). If you notice a trend of increasing resource usage over time, investigate root causes (perhaps additional integration or a memory leak in a module).\nFor JACEs, keep the configuration lean: remove any unused integrations or logic. The limited hardware of embedded controllers means unnecessary components can consume precious resources.\nIf using a Supervisor (server) for trending and analytics, offload heavy tasks from field JACEs to the Supervisor. JACEs should ideally focus on real-time control, with long-term data handling done at higher level.\nPlan for capacity upgrades if needed. For example, if an office building adds many VAV controllers and trends, you may need to upgrade from a JACE 8000 to a more powerful Edge controller or Supervisor, or distribute the load among multiple JACEs. Niagara’s resource metrics will inform this decision.\nEnsure the Niagara version is up-to-date. Newer Niagara updates often include performance improvements and fixes. (Tridium recommends updating to the latest stable release for best security and performance.",true
