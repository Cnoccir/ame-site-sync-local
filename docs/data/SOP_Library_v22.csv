Navigate to Platform Administration ? Backup/Restore. This opens the backup dialog for the host device [1].<br> Create Station Backup: Select the running Station in the backup dialog and click ""Backup Station"". You will be prompted to choose a save location for the backup file (.dist extension) [2]. The station will continue running while it packages the backup. Ensure you include all necessary data:<br> - Name the Backup: Use a clear naming convention (e.g. SchoolABuilding_2025-07-22_PMBackup).<br> - Include History/Alarms: Check the BackupService settings to ensure history/alarm data folders are not excluded [3]. Note: Large histories can make backups big; you may omit very large history databases and rely on separate archiving.<br> - Start Backup: Click ""Create"" to begin. A full station backup (.dist file) will be created [4].<br> Verify & Store Backup: Confirm successful completion. The .dist file is typically saved in your Workbench backups folder [5]. Verify the files timestamp and size. Store a copy externally (drive, network, cloud).<br> Test the Backup (Optional): Occasionally, test restoring a backup on a test station to verify its integrity.<br> Why Its Important: A current backup allows fast recovery. A JACE failure at a school, for example, can be fixed in hours with a backup instead of days rebuilding. The backup enables ""complete replication from one backup file"" [6].",,,,," Perform backups regularly (at least quarterly) and maintain multiple historical copies.<br> Keep backups secure and use password protection if available, as they contain sensitive system credentials.<br> Monitor backup file size to ensure completeness and manage history data growth.<br> If a backup fails, check disk space and JACE status.

Clear All Records will wipe the entire history [7].<br> - Execute Purge: Click ""Run Maintenance"" to perform the action [8].<br> - Verify Space: Check free space on the JACE file system after purging. A JACE-8000 has a 384 MB RAM disk for histories [9].<br> Set History Retention Limits: Configure each historys capacity to a specific record count or duration instead of ""Unlimited"" [10].<br> Archiving Strategy: Use a Supervisor to pull histories from JACEs daily [11].

Compare the reference reading to the value shown in Niagara.<br> Apply Calibration/Offset: If a sensor is out of tolerance, adjust it. This can be done via physical potentiometers or, more commonly, through a software offset in the controller's configuration within Niagara [1, 2, 3]. If the sensor reads low, apply a positive offset; if it reads high, apply a negative one.<br> Record Calibration: Document all changes: which sensor was adjusted, the offset value, and the date.

Note the existing values.<br> Test the Loop Response: During off-peak times, introduce a setpoint change and observe the loop's reaction using real-time charts. Note any overshoot, undershoot, or oscillation.<br> - Tune P, I, and D: Adjust the Proportional (P) gain first to get a decent response, then add Integral (I) action to eliminate steady-state error, and only use Derivative (D) if necessary to dampen overshoot in fast-acting systems [1, 2, 3].<br> Fine-tune: Make iterative adjustments, allowing the loop to settle after each change.
