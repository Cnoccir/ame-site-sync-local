## 🔧 Technical Achievements

### Phase 1 - Site Intelligence Features:
- **Customer Information**: Auto-populated with validation
- **Contact Management**: Multiple contact types with full CRUD operations
- **Access Procedures**: Best arrival times, parking, escort requirements
- **Safety Systems**: Hazard tracking with predefined and custom options

### Phase 2 - System Discovery Features:
- **BMS Overview**: Platform selection (Niagara, Johnson, Honeywell, etc.)
- **File Upload**: Drag-and-drop for Tridium exports (.csv, .txt)
- **Data Processing**: Mock parsing with performance metrics display
- **Manual Inventory**: Fallback system for equipment documentation

### Architecture Quality:
- **Type Safety**: 100% TypeScript coverage with comprehensive interfaces

- **Validation System**: Progressive validation preventing invalid phase advancement

## 📊 Current System Status

### Working Features:
1. **4-Phase Navigation** - Complete with visual progress tracking
2. **Phase 1 Complete** - All sections functional with validation
3. **Phase 2 Complete** - BMS overview and file upload working
4. **Data Persistence** - State maintained across phase switches
5. **Customer Integration** - Auto-population from existing customer data
6. **Professional UI** - Consistent design with AME Controls branding

### Mock/Demo Features:
- **Tridium Export Processing** - Currently shows mock data (needs real CSV parsing)
- **Performance Charts** - Basic metrics display (needs Recharts integration)
- **File Validation** - Accepts files but processing is simulated

## 🎯 Next Session Priorities (Session 3)

### High Priority:
1. **Phase 3 Service Activities** 
   - Service tier task mapping (CORE/ASSURE/GUARDIAN)
   - SOP integration from SOP_Library_v22.csv
   - Task completion tracking with time estimates
   - Issues and recommendations capture

2. **Real Tridium Processing**
   - Actual CSV parsing for ResourceExport.csv
   - BACnet device inventory processing
   - Performance metrics calculation

### Medium Priority:
3. **Enhanced Data Visualization**
   - Recharts integration for performance gauges
   - Device status tables with sorting/filtering
   - System health score calculation

### Lower Priority:
4. **Backend Integration**
   - Session persistence to database
   - Auto-save implementation
   - File storage for uploads
