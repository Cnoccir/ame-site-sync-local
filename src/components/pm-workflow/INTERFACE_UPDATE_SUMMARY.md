# âœ… INTERFACE UPDATE COMPLETE

## What Changed

The **Phase 2 System Discovery** interface in the PM workflow has been updated to use the new comprehensive **TridiumDataManager** instead of the previous simple upload components.

## Updated Files

### 1. **Primary Interface Update**
- **File**: `src/components/pm-workflow/phases/Phase2SystemDiscovery.tsx`
- **Change**: Replaced `TridiumSystemTreeWizard` and `TridiumDataEditor` with `TridiumDataManager`
- **Location**: Discovery tab in Phase 2 of PM workflow

### 2. **New Components Added**
- **TridiumDataManager.tsx** - Main orchestrator component
- **FileTrackingPanel.tsx** - Complete file tracking and verification
- **DeviceInventoryManager.tsx** - Device management with editing capabilities
- **TridiumImportWizard.tsx** - Enhanced hierarchical upload wizard
- **index.ts** - Proper exports for all components

## How to Access the New Interface

1. **Navigate to PM Workflow**:
   - Go to PM Guidance page (`/pm-guidance`)
   - Enter or select Phase 2 (System Discovery)
   - Click on the "Discovery" tab

2. **New Interface Features**:
   - **Upload Phase**: Hierarchical tree-based file upload with auto-detection
   - **Review Phase**: Complete file tracking, data visualization, and system hierarchy
   - **Edit Phase**: Full device inventory management with add/edit/delete capabilities
   - **Management Phase**: Change tracking, re-processing, and data export

## Interface Workflow

### Phase 1: Upload
- Tree-based upload interface (like Niagara workbench)
- Auto-detects Supervisor vs Single-JACE systems
- Shows real-time JACE discovery from network files
- Proper file categorization and validation

### Phase 2: Review & Data Management
- **System Hierarchy Tab**: Interactive tree view of entire system
- **File Tracking Tab**: Shows exactly where each file went and what data was extracted
- **Device Inventory Tab**: Complete device management with search, filter, edit capabilities
- **Resources Tab**: Performance metrics and system resource data

### Phase 3: Edit & Control
- **Edit Mode Toggle**: Switch between view and edit modes
- **Device Management**: Add, edit, delete devices with bulk operations
- **Change Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all modifications
- **Re-processing**: Automatic detection when files need re-parsing

### Phase 4: Export & Integration
- **Report Generation**: Prepare data for PDF reporting
- **Data Export**: JSON/CSV export capabilities
- **Integration Ready**: Properly formatted for existing report builder

## Key Improvements

1. **Complete File Tracking**: Users can see exactly where each file went and what data was extracted
2. **User Control**: Full editing capabilities for all system data
3. **Hierarchical Visualization**: System structure matches actual Tridium hierarchy
4. **Change Management**: Complete audit trail and re-processing capabilities
5. **Professional Interface**: Clean, organized, and intuitive user experience

## Technical Implementation

- **TypeScript**: Full type safety throughout
- **React Components**: Modular, reusable component architecture
- **Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with existing PM workflow
- **Performance**: Optimized for large device inventories
- **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

The interface is now live and accessible through the existing PM workflow navigation.
