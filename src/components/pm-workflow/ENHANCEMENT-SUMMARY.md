# Enhanced Tridium Import Wizard - Progressive File Upload System

## 🎯 Problem Solved

**Original Issue:** *"We need a way to handle multiple file uploads, maybe small tree view construction and suggested files to upload and order? The current system is close but if the user uploads one file we don't have a way to upload another."*

**✅ Solution Delivered:** Complete progressive file upload management system with intelligent guidance and real-time feedback.

## 🗂️ File Management Tree Structure

### Visual Organization
```
📁 File Requirements (2/4 processed)
├── 📊 Resource Export ✅ (Required)
│   ├── Jace1_ResourceExport.csv (45.2 KB) 
│   └── Drop zone: "Upload Resource Export here"
├── 🔧 Platform Details ⚠️ (Required) 
│   ├── Suggestions: PlatformDetails.txt, JacePlatformDetails.txt
│   └── Drop zone: "Drop Platform Details here"  
├── 🌐 BACnet Export ✅ (Optional)
│   ├── JaceBacnetExport.csv (12.1 KB)
│   └── Processing: 45 devices detected

└── 🔗 Network Export ➕ (Auto-added for Multi-JACE)
    ├── Suggestions: NiagaraNetExport.csv
    └── Drop zone: "Drop Network Export here"
```

### Status Indicators
- ✅ **Processed** - File uploaded and data extracted (green)
- 🔄 **Uploaded** - File received, processing in progress (blue, animated)
- ⚠️ **Missing** - Required/recommended file not uploaded (amber)
- ❌ **Error** - Upload or processing failed (red)

## 🔄 Enhanced User Workflow

### Before (Original Issue)
1. Upload all files at once in step 1
2. No way to add more files after initial upload
3. No guidance on what files are needed
4. Confusing if you miss something
5. No way to see what's missing

### After (Enhanced System)
1. **Start with any file** - upload what you have
2. **Get smart suggestions** - see what's recommended next
3. **Add files progressively** - upload additional files anytime
4. **Real-time feedback** - watch architecture detection evolve
5. **Clear requirements** - visual tree shows exactly what's needed
6. **Fix mistakes easily** - remove/replace files with one click

## 📊 Real-Time Intelligence Features

### Smart Recommendations Engine
```typescript
// Example of dynamic recommendations
if (hasResourceExport && !hasPlatformDetails) {
  recommend("Upload PlatformDetails.txt for complete system info");
}

if (architectureDetection.confidence < 50) {
  recommend("Upload more files to determine system architecture");
}

if (architectureDetection.architecture === 'multi-jace' && !hasNetworkExport) {
  recommend("Upload NiagaraNetExport.csv for network topology");
}
```

### Progressive Architecture Detection
```typescript
interface ArchitectureDetection {
  architecture: 'single-jace' | 'multi-jace' | 'unknown';
  confidence: number;        // 0-100%, updates with each file
  indicators: string[];      // "Supervisor files detected", etc.
  recommendations: string[]; // Smart next steps
}
```

## 🎨 UI/UX Improvements

### Layout Enhancement
- **Two-panel layout** - File tree (left) + Main content (right)
- **Persistent sidebar** - Always visible file management
- **Sticky positioning** - File tree stays in view during scrolling
- **Responsive design** - Adapts to different screen sizes

### Visual Feedback
- **Progress bars** for overall and required file completion
- **Color coding** for different file states
- **Expandable sections** in file tree for detailed information
- **Drag-and-drop highlights** for targeted upload zones

### Interactive Elements
- **Individual upload buttons** for each file category
- **Expandable file details** showing size, processing status
- **Remove file buttons** for easy file management
- **Global drop zone** for flexible file uploads

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### File Management State
```typescript
interface FileRequirement {
  category: FileCategory;
  name: string;
  description: string;
  required: boolean;
  patterns: string[];           // For auto-categorization
  status: 'missing' | 'uploaded' | 'processed' | 'error';
  uploadedFile?: UploadedFileInfo;
  suggestions?: string[];       // Smart file name suggestions
}
```

### Progressive Processing
```typescript
// Files are processed individually and cumulatively
const processFiles = async () => {
  // Process all uploaded files together
  const processed = await TridiumExportProcessor.processFiles(allFiles);
  
  // Update architecture detection with new data
  const archDetection = detectArchitecture(processed);
  
  // Update file requirements based on new architecture
  updateFileRequirements(archDetection);
};
```
