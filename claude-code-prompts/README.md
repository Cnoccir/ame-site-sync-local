## Quick Start - Real Data + Google Drive Integration

For maximum immediate impact with your current architecture:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd C:\Users\tech\Projects\ame-site-sync-local

# Step 1: Real data integration (most impactful for current needs)
claude-code implement claude-code-prompts/06-real-data-crud-integration.md

# Step 2: Google Drive intelligence (perfect for your Loveable.dev + Supabase setup)
claude-code implement claude-code-prompts/07-google-drive-intelligence.md
```

**Combined Benefits:**
1. **Real customer/contract data** with automatic service tier calculation
2. **Full CRUD operations** with smart validation
3. **Automatic project folder discovery** using Google Drive API
4. **Intelligent folder matching** to customer names
5. **Seamless Pre-Visit integration** with auto-linked documentation

## Next Steps After Prompt 6

Once you have real data integration working:
1. **Test thoroughly** with your actual customer/contract data
2. **Validate service tier calculations** match your expectations  
3. **Try the edit functionality** on various customer records
4. **Proceed to Prompt 1** for site intelligence features
5. **Continue with remaining prompts** based on priority

## Implementation Timeline

- **Prompt 6 (Real Data)**: 3-5 days - **IMMEDIATE VALUE**
- **Prompt 7 (Google Drive)**: 2-3 days - **HIGH IMPACT** for your architecture
- **Prompts 1-2**: 1 week - Foundation intelligence
- **Prompts 3-5**: 2-3 weeks - Advanced features

**Total**: 5-7 weeks for complete system, but **immediate transformation** from Prompts 6+7!

The combination of real data integration + Google Drive intelligence will provide instant transformation from mock interface to a fully intelligent system that automatically discovers and links your project documentation.
