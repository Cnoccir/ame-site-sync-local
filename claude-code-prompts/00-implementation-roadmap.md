## Testing Strategy

### After Each Prompt Implementation
1. **Functional Testing**: Core features work as specified
2. **Data Integrity**: No data corruption or loss
3. **User Experience**: Features are intuitive and helpful
4. **Performance**: No significant slowdowns
5. **Integration**: New features integrate smoothly with existing system

### Integration Testing (Between Phases)
- Test data flow between components
- Verify recommendation accuracy improves with more data
- Ensure report quality enhances with complete assessments

### End-to-End Testing (After All Implementations)
- Complete visit workflow from start to finish
- Verify all team feedback points are addressed
- Test with various system types and service tiers

- No modifications to existing data structures
- Migration scripts can be reversed if needed

### Component Updates
- New components supplement existing ones
- Original functionality preserved during transition
- Feature flags can disable new features if issues arise

### Service Enhancements
- New services are additive, not replacements
- Existing APIs remain functional
- Progressive enhancement approach

## Success Metrics

### Team Feedback Resolution
- [ ] Rob's job number confusion: **RESOLVED** (Prompt 1)
- [ ] Rob's timing/POC issues: **RESOLVED** (Prompt 2) 
- [ ] Rob's PM handoff needs: **RESOLVED** (Prompts 1, 5)
- [ ] John's system type visibility: **RESOLVED** (Prompt 3)
- [ ] Hallucinated content elimination: **RESOLVED** (Prompt 5)

### System Performance
- [ ] Visit preparation time reduced by 40%+
- [ ] On-site efficiency improved by 25%+  
- [ ] Report quality significantly enhanced
- [ ] Technician satisfaction increased
- [ ] Customer satisfaction measurably improved

### Knowledge Management
- [ ] Site intelligence accumulates with each visit
- [ ] Troubleshooting knowledge preserved and shared

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Database Migration Issues**: Test on development environment first
- **Performance Degradation**: Monitor query performance, add indexes as needed
- **Integration Failures**: Implement with feature flags for safe rollback

### User Adoption Risks  
- **Feature Complexity**: Implement progressive disclosure
- **Training Requirements**: Create in-app guidance and help
- **Resistance to Change**: Phase rollout allows gradual adoption

### Business Risks
- **Development Time**: Each prompt is scoped for manageable implementation
- **Resource Requirements**: Minimal additional infrastructure needed
- **Maintenance Burden**: Code is designed for maintainability

## Next Steps

1. **Review this roadmap** with your development team
2. **Set up development environment** for first prompt
3. **Begin with Prompt 1** (Site Intelligence System)
4. **Validate each phase** before proceeding to next
5. **Gather user feedback** throughout implementation process
